I joined the [LISTIC](https://www.univ-smb.fr/listic/en/) laboratory ([University Savoie Mont Blanc](https://www.univ-smb.fr/)) and the [L2S](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/en/) ([CentraleSup√©lec, University Paris-Saclay](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/)) in December 2022 as a PhD student under the supervision of [Yajing YAN](https://www.univ-smb.fr/listic/pages-fr/yajing-yan-fr/), [Mohammed Nabil El Korso](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/en/u/el-korso-mohammed-nabil/) and [Guillaume Ginolhac](https://www.univ-smb.fr/listic/presentation/membres/enseignants-chercheurs/guillaume-ginolhac/).


I am interested in the potential of regular Sentinel-1 A/B SAR images, as they offer both opportunities and challenges for scientists monitoring Earth deformation through SAR image time series. The primary goal of my PhD thesis is to develop a novel, robust, and sequential Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) approach that takes into account the structure of the covariance matrix and temporal decorrelation models, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the Phase Linking method. This proposed methodology will deepen our understanding of Earth deformation through SAR image time series and provide valuable insights for operational monitoring.
